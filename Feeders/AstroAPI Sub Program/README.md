AstroAPI Readme

Almost entirely backend API calls for Astrological Data retrieval with
the following use cases currently:
* Daily Transit Report for Neo4j input
* Natal Chart retrieval for new Users added to database with sufficient birth data

More use cases will be added in the future, as possible

UI/Front End will be built for manual retrieval of either API type, a natal
chart or transit chart, with a specified natal
